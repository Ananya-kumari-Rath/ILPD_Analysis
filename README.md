# ILPD Data Analysis Project

## Overview:
This project performs a data analysis of the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) using logistic regression. 
The main objective is to predict the likelihood of liver disease based on various health metrics in the dataset. 
The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset:
Data collected from UCI ML reposetory.

*Key Features:*
Age: Age of the patient.
Gender: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
Total Bilirubin: Measure of bilirubin in the blood.
Direct Bilirubin: Measure of direct bilirubin in the blood.
Alkaline Phosphatase: Enzyme level.
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): Enzyme level.
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): Enzyme level.
Total Proteins: Total proteins in the blood.
Albumin: Blood protein level.
Albumin and Globulin Ratio: Ratio of albumin to globulin.
Label: Target variable indicating liver disease (1 for liver patient, 0 for non-liver patient)

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.x Libraries:
- `pandas` - For data manipulation
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` - For logistic regression and model evaluation
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - For visualization

## Conclusion
This project provides a framework for understanding the ILPD and using logistic regression to predict liver disease. Further improvements could include using other classification models (e.g., decision trees, SVM) and more feature engineering.
